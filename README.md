# NETPUG2.0
NETPUG 2! This version shy's away from manually defining graphs and uses the JavaFXSmartGraph to operate.

It aims to be able to become a more modern alternative to Zenmap and to allow for more user customisability, and to be more user-friendly than its alternatives. It will do this by allowing for custom CSS styling which will help for people with visual impairments.
